  <p class="profile-text profile-formating"> Hi my name is Josh Owen, and at age 25 I have 19 kids. I don’t want to force anything on them, but I am raising them up to be world-class coders. Don’t tell my daughters, but I am getting them matching shirts called “Girls Who Code”. I am sure they will love it. In other news, Laban has a lair now.
I grew up working in the family “flower” business. I say flowers, but we are really the largest cannabis grower in the US. My life took a different direction when I met the man Jesus. I now live a life in the both/ands, seeking to love the rich in wealth, but poor in spirit. I want to give my lovely wife, Alaina, a shoutout for somehow managing to feed all our kiddos.
In my free time, I like to slack line and am known among my peers to be the King of Catan.
You will often find me in a sort of Mijas frat boy look consisting of mid-thigh shorts, a low buttoned up shirt, and flip flops.</p>
